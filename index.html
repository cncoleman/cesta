        <a href="/projects/post.html"><h4>Geography of the Post</h4>
        <img class="project" src="/images/proj_geography.png"/></a>
        <p>From the end of the Civil War until the close of the nineteenth century, the United States Postal System grew into a vast communications network. The Post was one of the century's largest spatial systems, with more than 75,000 offices connecting communities scattered across the continent. Geography of the Post maps this behemoth network on its western periphery: where it spread, how it operated, and its role in shaping the space and place of the region.</p>

        <a href="/projects/prussia.html"><h4>Chinese Railroad Workers</h4>
        <img class="project" src="/images/proj_railroad.png"/></a>
        <p>Between 1865 and 1869, thousands of Chinese migrants toiled at a grueling pace and in perilous working conditions to help construct America’s First Transcontinental Railroad.  The Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project seeks to give a voice to the Chinese migrants whose labor on the Transcontinental Railroad helped to shape the physical and social landscape of the American West. The Project coordinates research in the United States and Asia in order to create an on-line digital archive available to all. </p>
